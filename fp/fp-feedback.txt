Please fill out the following and submit with your Final Project submission 
(added to help us know what to focus on when grading, what was intentionally incomplete, etc.):

1. What is your estimated grade for the Final Project (roughly of 100)? For partner projects,
   do you think the workload distribution was fair?
95 (didn't have a partner)

2. What is your estimated grade for the course (letter grade)? You can support your
   estimate with examples of demonstrated engagement in the course material, strengths
   (and weaknesses) over the term, and growth throughout the material (some assignment
   grading feedback was delayed, but we would like to know what resources you used to
   iterate on the material, such as lectures, OH, Discord, etc.)
A, I always went to class, when we still had our regular class time, where I asked questions
and actively engaged in class. I also attended some OHs and asked questions on discord when I
was stuck. I rewatched lecture videos or reviewed lecture slides when I was still confused
about the material and studied the cheat sheets.

3. To what extent would you like feedback in your project (e.g. thorough, particular areas of the
   project, or just a grade)?
The API related things because I was a bit shaky on that

4. Anything else you would like El to know when grading?
I spent a lot of time on this project and wasn't able to finsih unfortunatly :(

5. Are you open to sharing your project/reflection for future terms? If so, would you
   like named credit or anonymous?
sure
